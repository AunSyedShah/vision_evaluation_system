# OTP Verification Filter for Evaluator Assignment

## üéØ Issue
System was showing all users with "User" role in evaluator assignment, including those who haven't verified their OTP. This could lead to assigning unverified evaluators to projects.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Updated Filter Logic
Both assignment methods now filter evaluators to show **ONLY verified users**:

1. **AssignEvaluatorsModal.jsx** (Quick Assign)
2. **ProjectDetail.jsx** (Detailed Assign Tab)

### Filter Criteria
```javascript
// Must meet BOTH conditions:
1. Role === 'User' (Evaluator role)
2. IsOtpVerified === true (OTP verified)
```

### Code Implementation
```javascript
const evaluatorsList = Array.isArray(allEvaluators) 
  ? allEvaluators.filter(user => {
      const role = user.Role || user.role || user.RoleName || user.roleName;
      const isVerified = user.IsOtpVerified || user.isOtpVerified || false;
      
      // Must be an evaluator role AND OTP verified
      const isEvaluatorRole = role === 'User' || role === 'user' || 
                              role === 'Evaluator' || role === 'evaluator';
      return isEvaluatorRole && isVerified;
    })
  : [];
```

## üìä User Model Reference

From `VisionManagement/Models/User.cs`:

```csharp
public partial class User
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; } = null!;
    public string Email { get; set; } = null!;
    
    // OTP Verification Fields
    public string? OtpCode { get; set; }
    public DateTime? OtpExpiration { get; set; }
    public bool IsOtpVerified { get; set; } = false;  // ‚úÖ This field!
    
    public int RoleId { get; set; }
    public virtual Role Role { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

## üîí Security Benefits

### Before (‚ùå Insecure)
- Showed all users with role "User"
- Could assign unverified evaluators
- Unverified users could access evaluation features
- Potential for spam/fake accounts

### After (‚úÖ Secure)
- Shows only OTP-verified evaluators
- Cannot assign unverified users to projects
- Ensures only legitimate evaluators can evaluate
- Protects evaluation integrity

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. **Verified Evaluator** ‚úÖ
- User: Has role "User"
- OTP Status: `IsOtpVerified = true`
- **Expected**: Should appear in assignment list
- **Action**: Can be assigned to projects

#### 2. **Unverified Evaluator** ‚ùå
- User: Has role "User"
- OTP Status: `IsOtpVerified = false`
- **Expected**: Should NOT appear in assignment list
- **Action**: Cannot be assigned to projects

#### 3. **Verified Non-Evaluator** ‚ùå
- User: Has role "SuperAdmin" or "FSO"
- OTP Status: `IsOtpVerified = true`
- **Expected**: Should NOT appear in assignment list
- **Action**: Not an evaluator role

#### 4. **No Evaluators Available**
- Scenario: No verified evaluators in system
- **Expected**: Shows "No Evaluators Available" message
- **Action**: Cannot assign anyone

## üé® UI Feedback

### When No Verified Evaluators
```jsx
<div className="text-center py-12">
  <div className="text-6xl mb-4">üë•</div>
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">
    No Evaluators Available
  </h3>
  <p className="text-gray-600">
    There are no verified users with the "Evaluator" role in the system.
  </p>
</div>
```

### Console Logs (for debugging)
```
üìã All Evaluators (extracted): [{...}, {...}]
üìã First user structure: {UserId: 1, Username: "evaluator1", ...}
üë§ User: evaluator1 Role: User Verified: true ‚úÖ
üë§ User: evaluator2 Role: User Verified: false ‚ùå (filtered out)
‚úÖ Filtered verified evaluators: [{UserId: 1, ...}]
```

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. **src/components/AssignEvaluatorsModal.jsx**
**Changes**:
- Added `IsOtpVerified` check in filter
- Added console logs for verification status
- Filters out unverified evaluators

**Line ~30-45**: Filter logic updated

### 2. **src/pages/SuperAdmin/ProjectDetail.jsx**
**Changes**:
- Added `IsOtpVerified` check in filter
- Added console logs for debugging
- Filters out unverified evaluators

**Line ~33-50**: Filter logic updated

## üîç Field Name Variations Supported

The code handles multiple naming conventions:

| Backend Field | Frontend Variations |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `Role` | `Role`, `role`, `RoleName`, `roleName` |
| `IsOtpVerified` | `IsOtpVerified`, `isOtpVerified` |
| `Username` | `Username`, `username` |
| `Email` | `Email`, `email` |
| `UserId` | `UserId`, `userId`, `Id`, `id` |

This ensures compatibility with different serialization formats.

- ‚úÖ Ensures evaluation integrity
- ‚úÖ Protects against spam/fake accounts

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ Clear feedback when no evaluators available
- ‚úÖ Only shows actionable options

## üí° Related Features

### OTP Verification Flow
1. User registers ‚Üí Receives OTP code
2. User verifies OTP ‚Üí `IsOtpVerified = true`
3. User can now be assigned to projects
4. User can access evaluation features

### Role-Based Access
- **SuperAdmin**: Full system access
- **FSO (Admin)**: View projects, view results
- **User (Evaluator)**: Evaluate assigned projects (only if verified)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No evaluators showing in modal
**Possible Causes**:
1. No users with role "User" in system
2. All evaluators have `IsOtpVerified = false`
3. Field name mismatch (check console logs)

**Solution**:
- Check console logs: `üë§ User: ... Role: ... Verified: ...`
- Verify users in database have `IsOtpVerified = true`
- Ensure role is set to "User"

### Issue: Unverified users still showing
**Check**:
1. Browser cache (hard refresh: Ctrl+F5)
2. Backend returning correct `IsOtpVerified` value
3. Filter logic is applied (check console logs)

---

## üìö Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do
- Always filter by `IsOtpVerified` in critical features
- Log verification status for debugging
- Show clear messages when no verified users available
- Handle both PascalCase and camelCase field names

### ‚ùå Don't
- Don't assign unverified evaluators to projects
- Don't skip OTP verification in production
- Don't show unverified users in selection lists
- Don't assume all users with role "User" are verified

---

## üéì Implementation Pattern

This pattern should be applied to ALL features where evaluator selection is needed:

```javascript
// Template for filtering verified evaluators
const verifiedEvaluators = users.filter(user => {
  const role = user.Role || user.role;
  const isVerified = user.IsOtpVerified || user.isOtpVerified || false;
  const isEvaluatorRole = role === 'User' || role === 'user';
  
  return isEvaluatorRole && isVerified; // BOTH conditions required
});
```

**Apply this to**:
- ‚úÖ Project assignment modals
- ‚úÖ Evaluator selection dropdowns
- ‚úÖ Evaluator listing pages
- ‚úÖ Any feature that displays/selects evaluators

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Status

**Feature**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

Both assignment methods now properly filter for verified evaluators only:
1. ‚úÖ Quick Assign (ProjectList modal)
2. ‚úÖ Detailed Assign (ProjectDetail tab)

**Security**: ‚úÖ **IMPROVED**
- Unverified users cannot be assigned to projects
- Evaluation integrity maintained

**Testing**: ‚è≥ **Pending**
- Test with verified evaluator (should appear)
- Test with unverified evaluator (should not appear)
- Test with no verified evaluators (should show message)

**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Priority**: High (Security Feature)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented - Ready for Testing
