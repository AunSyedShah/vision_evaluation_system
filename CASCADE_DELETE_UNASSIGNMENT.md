# Cascade Deletion: Unassign Evaluator with Evaluation Cleanup

## Overview
When SuperAdmin unassigns an evaluator from a project, the system now automatically deletes their evaluation (if exists), ensuring data consistency.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: Unassigning an evaluator left orphaned evaluation data in the database.
**After**: Unassignment cascade deletes associated evaluation, maintaining referential integrity.

## Implementation

### Endpoint Updated
**DELETE** `/api/SuperAdmin/unassignUser/{projectId}/{userId}`

**Authorization**: Bearer Token (SuperAdmin role required)

**Route Parameters**:
- `projectId` (int): The project ID
- `userId` (int): The evaluator's user ID to unassign

### Behavior

#### Case 1: Evaluator Has Submitted Evaluation
**Scenario**: Evaluator completed evaluation for the project before being unassigned.

**Actions**:
1. ✅ Find project assignment
2. ✅ Find associated evaluation
3. ✅ **DELETE evaluation** (CASCADE)
4. ✅ DELETE project assignment
5. ✅ Save changes atomically

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "message": "User 5 unassigned from project 10 successfully.",
  "evaluationDeleted": true,
  "details": "Associated evaluation was also deleted."
}
```

**Database Impact**:
- ❌ Row deleted from `Evaluations` table
- ❌ Row deleted from `ProjectAssignments` table

---

#### Case 2: Evaluator Has NOT Submitted Evaluation
**Scenario**: Evaluator was assigned but never completed evaluation.

**Actions**:
1. ✅ Find project assignment
2. ✅ Check for evaluation (none exists)
3. ✅ DELETE project assignment only
4. ✅ Save changes

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "message": "User 5 unassigned from project 10 successfully.",
  "evaluationDeleted": false,
  "details": "No evaluation existed for this assignment."
}
```

**Database Impact**:
- ❌ Row deleted from `ProjectAssignments` table
- ℹ️ No evaluation to delete

---

### Code Changes

**File**: `VisionManagement/Controllers/SuperAdminController.cs`

**Method**: `UnassignUser(int projectId, int userId)`

**New Logic**:
```csharp
// Check if evaluator has submitted an evaluation for this project
var evaluation = await _context.Evaluations
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(e => e.ProjectId == projectId && e.UserId == userId);

bool hadEvaluation = evaluation != null;

// CASCADE DELETE: Remove evaluation if it exists
if (evaluation != null)
{
    _context.Evaluations.Remove(evaluation);
}

// Remove project assignment
_context.ProjectAssignments.Remove(assignment);

await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

**Response Enhancement**:
```csharp
return Ok(new
{
    message = $"User {userId} unassigned from project {projectId} successfully.",
    evaluationDeleted = hadEvaluation,
    details = hadEvaluation 
        ? "Associated evaluation was also deleted." 
        : "No evaluation existed for this assignment."
});
```

## Benefits

### Data Consistency
- ✅ No orphaned evaluation records
- ✅ Referential integrity maintained
- ✅ Clean database state

### User Experience
- ✅ Clear feedback on what was deleted
- ✅ Transparent operation (evaluationDeleted flag)
- ✅ Safe operation (handles both cases)

### System Integrity
- ✅ Prevents invalid evaluation statistics
- ✅ Accurate completion rates
- ✅ Reliable evaluation counts

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Unassign Evaluator With Evaluation
**Request**:
```http
DELETE /api/SuperAdmin/unassignUser/10/5
Authorization: Bearer <superadmin-token>
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "User 5 unassigned from project 10 successfully.",
  "evaluationDeleted": true,
  "details": "Associated evaluation was also deleted."
}
```

**What Happened**:
- Evaluator had completed their evaluation
- Both assignment AND evaluation were deleted
- Project statistics automatically recalculated

---

### Example 2: Unassign Evaluator Without Evaluation
**Request**:
```http
DELETE /api/SuperAdmin/unassignUser/10/7
Authorization: Bearer <superadmin-token>
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "User 7 unassigned from project 10 successfully.",
  "evaluationDeleted": false,
  "details": "No evaluation existed for this assignment."
}
```

**What Happened**:
- Evaluator had not submitted evaluation yet
- Only assignment was deleted
- Safe unassignment completed

---

### Example 3: Unassign Non-Existent Assignment
**Request**:
```http
DELETE /api/SuperAdmin/unassignUser/10/99
Authorization: Bearer <superadmin-token>
```

**Response** (404 Not Found):
```json
{
  "message": "No assignment found for user 99 in project 10."
}
```

---

## Impact on Other Endpoints

### `GET /api/Evaluations/statistics/{projectId}`
- ✅ Automatically reflects reduced evaluation count
- ✅ Completion rate recalculates correctly
- ✅ Average scores exclude deleted evaluation

### `GET /api/Evaluations` (SuperAdmin - all evaluations)
- ✅ Deleted evaluation no longer appears
- ✅ List remains consistent

### `GET /api/Evaluations/my` (Evaluator)
- ✅ Deleted evaluation removed from evaluator's list
- ✅ Evaluator can no longer see/edit deleted evaluation

---

## Error Handling

### Possible Errors

**404 Not Found**:
- Assignment doesn't exist
- User/Project combination not found

**401 Unauthorized**:
- Missing or invalid token

**403 Forbidden**:
- User is not SuperAdmin

**500 Internal Server Error**:
- Database connection issues
- Transaction failure

---

## Transaction Safety

The operation uses Entity Framework's atomic transaction:
```csharp
// Both deletes are in same transaction
if (evaluation != null)
    _context.Evaluations.Remove(evaluation);

_context.ProjectAssignments.Remove(assignment);

// Atomic commit - either both succeed or both fail
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

**Atomicity Guarantee**:
- ✅ Both deletes succeed together
- ✅ Or both fail together
- ❌ Never partial state (assignment deleted but evaluation remains)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases

1. **✅ Unassign evaluator with completed evaluation**
   - Verify evaluation is deleted
   - Verify assignment is deleted
   - Verify response shows `evaluationDeleted: true`

2. **✅ Unassign evaluator without evaluation**
   - Verify assignment is deleted
   - Verify response shows `evaluationDeleted: false`

3. **✅ Verify project statistics update**
   - Check evaluation count decreases
   - Check completion rate recalculates

4. **✅ Verify evaluator's list updates**
   - Evaluator can no longer see deleted evaluation
   - Evaluator cannot access project detail

5. **✅ Test with non-existent assignment**
   - Returns 404 error
   - Database unchanged

6. **✅ Test authorization**
   - Non-SuperAdmin gets 403
   - No token gets 401

### Edge Cases

- Multiple evaluators on same project
- Last evaluator being unassigned
- Rapid consecutive unassignments
- Database transaction rollback scenarios

---

## Frontend Integration

### API Response Handling

**api.js** (if function exists):
```javascript
export const unassignEvaluator = async (projectId, userId) => {
  const response = await api.delete(`/SuperAdmin/unassignUser/${projectId}/${userId}`);
  return response.data; // { message, evaluationDeleted, details }
};
```

### UI Feedback

**Display to User**:
```javascript
const result = await unassignEvaluator(projectId, userId);

if (result.evaluationDeleted) {
  toast.warning(
    'Evaluator unassigned. Their evaluation was also deleted.',
    { icon: '⚠️' }
  );
} else {
  toast.success(
    'Evaluator unassigned successfully.',
    { icon: '✅' }
  );
}
```

**Confirmation Dialog** (Recommended):
```jsx
<ConfirmDialog
  title="Unassign Evaluator?"
  message="This evaluator has submitted an evaluation. Unassigning them will also DELETE their evaluation. This cannot be undone."
  confirmText="Unassign & Delete Evaluation"
  onConfirm={() => handleUnassign(projectId, userId)}
/>
```

---

## Database Schema

### Tables Affected

**ProjectAssignments** (always deleted):
```
ProjectAssignmentId | ProjectId | UserId
--------------------|-----------|-------
123                 | 10        | 5      ← DELETED
```

**Evaluations** (conditionally deleted):
```
EvaluationId | ProjectId | UserId | Scores... | EvaluatedAt
-------------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------
456          | 10        | 5      | ...       | 2025-10-01  ← DELETED if exists
```

---

## Migration Considerations

### Existing Data
No database migration needed - this is a business logic change only.

### Retroactive Cleanup (Optional)
If you have orphaned evaluations from before this feature:

```sql
-- Find orphaned evaluations (no corresponding assignment)
SELECT e.* 
FROM Evaluations e
LEFT JOIN ProjectAssignments pa 
  ON e.ProjectId = pa.ProjectId AND e.UserId = pa.UserId
WHERE pa.ProjectAssignmentId IS NULL;

-- Clean up orphaned evaluations (OPTIONAL - use with caution)
DELETE e
FROM Evaluations e
LEFT JOIN ProjectAssignments pa 
  ON e.ProjectId = pa.ProjectId AND e.UserId = pa.UserId
WHERE pa.ProjectAssignmentId IS NULL;
```

## Related Endpoints

### Complementary Endpoints

**POST** `/api/SuperAdmin/assignProject`
- Assigns evaluators to project
- Inverse operation of unassignment

**PUT** `/api/SuperAdmin/updateAssignment`
- Additive only (doesn't remove)
- Use unassignUser for removals

**GET** `/api/Evaluations/statistics/{projectId}`
- Automatically reflects changes
- Recalculates after unassignment

---

## Status
✅ **Implementation Complete**
- Cascade deletion logic added
- Response enhanced with deletion details
- No compilation errors
- Transaction safety ensured

⏳ **Frontend Update Recommended**
- Add confirmation dialog for evaluators with evaluations
- Display warning about evaluation deletion
- Show appropriate success/warning toasts
